Signal and Systems project

In this project, we aim to identify the gender of a recorded sound by analyzing its frequency. Male voices typically range between 85 and 180 Hz, while female voices fall between 165 and 255 Hz. We use the Fourier transform for spectral analysis to spot these frequency differences. Additionally, we develop code to open and plot the power spectrum of MP3 files, allowing us to classify male and female voices. In the second part, we focus on noise reduction using the Spectral Subtraction algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness on a test file corrupted with AWGN.
